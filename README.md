### Installation Info
All of the utilities rely on the Vector SDK being operational, ensure that the SDK is working on your device and communicating with your vector before using any of the utilities. [Here is the tutorial provided by Anki to do that](https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/index.html).

Ultimately, it doesn't matter where you install this repo, the SDK will be initialised by the main.py file. The folder structure and filenames must remain the same for the utilities to work however.
